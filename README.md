# ðŸ“¸ Instagram Data Modaling (MySQL)
## About the Project
This project is a simple Instagram-style database built with MySQL.
It covers the main features of Instagram like **users, posts, likes, comments, and followers**.

I designed the data model, created tables with relationships, inserted sample data, and wrote queries to do analytics like counting likes, ranking posts, and finding active users.
